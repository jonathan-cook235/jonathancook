I'm currently a Master's student, studying Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at UCL. I'm incredibly grateful to be funded and mentored by DeepMind. Often, I can be found at the UCL AI Centre, where I am supervised by Prof. Tim Rocktäschel at UCL Deciding, Acting and Reasoning with Knowledge (DARK) Lab. Right now, my research focuses on the generalisation capabilities of deep multi-agent reinforcement learning models, but I'm also deeply interested in the Collaborative AI research agenda; the problem of human-AI coordination in real-world systems; natural language understanding and probabilistic machine learning.
